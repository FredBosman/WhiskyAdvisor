## The Dataset

The dataset that I use is a set of 86 whiskies that have been classified in 12 variables. More than the 8 shown in the previous slide.
```{r dataset, echo=FALSE}
WhiskyData <- read.csv("whiskies.txt")

head(str(WhiskyData))

```

This dataset is readily avaible on the internet and has been used in several other data analyses.

## Entering your preference

As we saw in the previous slide, there are 12 variables - Body, Sweetness to Fruity, Floral - each of which as a value in the range of 0 to 4.

The Whisky Advisor has 12 sliders on the left side, one for each of the variables.
